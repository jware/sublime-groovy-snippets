# Sublime Text Groovy Snippets

This is NOT the package for Groovy language support in Sublime Text. If you were looking for that, you can find it [here](https://github.com/textmate/groovy-grails.tmbundle).

So, you may be wondering why we created this. We just wanted to add some more snippets that we found useful while developing Groovy/Grails applications. Or, in other words, we are lazy and want to type less and less every day :)

If you feel that is your case too, feel free to use (and extend) this snippets.

Also, if you are also struggling with GSP (Groovy Server Pages), check out our other package [here](https://github.com/mathifonseca/sublime-gsp-snippets).

##Installation
The easiest way to get these snippets, is by using [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/). If you already have it, you just need to search for **Groovy Snippets** and install it. In case you don't, take a look [here](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation).

##Usage
Once you have installed the snippets, the only thing you need to do is type the desired trigger and hit <kbd>Tab</kbd> (or whatever you have set as completion key). Also, you can press <kbd>âŒ˜ + Space</kbd> (or <kbd>Ctrl + Space</kbd>) to get a list of all available completions.

##Collaboration
If you think we got something wrong, have any suggestions, want to make a request or add some creation of your own, please feel free to contact us.
